# Logstash Filter Aggregate Documentation

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-aggregate.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-aggregate)

The aim of this filter is to aggregate information available among several events (typically log lines) belonging to a same task, and finally push aggregated information into final task event.

You should be very careful to set logstash filter workers to 1 (`-w 1` flag) for this filter to work 
correctly otherwise documents
may be processed out of sequence and unexpected results will occur.
 
## Example #1

* with these given logs : 
```
     INFO - 12345 - TASK_START - start
     INFO - 12345 - SQL - sqlQuery1 - 12
     INFO - 12345 - SQL - sqlQuery2 - 34
     INFO - 12345 - TASK_END - end
```

* you can aggregate "sql duration" for the whole task with this configuration : 
``` ruby
     filter {
         grok {
             match => [ "message", "%{LOGLEVEL:loglevel} - %{NOTSPACE:taskid} - %{NOTSPACE:logger} - %{WORD:label}( - %{INT:duration:int})?" ]
         }
     
         if [logger] == "TASK_START" {
             aggregate {
                 task_id => "%{taskid}"
                 code => "map['sql_duration'] = 0"
                 map_action => "create"
             }
         }
     
         if [logger] == "SQL" {
             aggregate {
                 task_id => "%{taskid}"
                 code => "map['sql_duration'] += event['duration']"
                 map_action => "update"
             }
         }
     
         if [logger] == "TASK_END" {
             aggregate {
                 task_id => "%{taskid}"
                 code => "event['sql_duration'] = map['sql_duration']"
                 map_action => "update"
                 end_of_task => true
                 timeout => 120
             }
         }
     }
```

* the final event then looks like :
``` ruby
{
         "message" => "INFO - 12345 - TASK_END - end",
    "sql_duration" => 46
}
```

the field `sql_duration` is added and contains the sum of all sql queries durations.

## Example #2

* If you have the same logs than example #1, but without a start log : 
```
     INFO - 12345 - SQL - sqlQuery1 - 12
     INFO - 12345 - SQL - sqlQuery2 - 34
     INFO - 12345 - TASK_END - end
```

* you can also aggregate "sql duration" with a slightly different configuration : 
``` ruby
     filter {
         grok {
             match => [ "message", "%{LOGLEVEL:loglevel} - %{NOTSPACE:taskid} - %{NOTSPACE:logger} - %{WORD:label}( - %{INT:duration:int})?" ]
         }
     
         if [logger] == "SQL" {
             aggregate {
                 task_id => "%{taskid}"
                 code => "map['sql_duration'] ||= 0 ; map['sql_duration'] += event['duration']"
             }
         }
     
         if [logger] == "TASK_END" {
             aggregate {
                 task_id => "%{taskid}"
                 code => "event['sql_duration'] = map['sql_duration']"
                 end_of_task => true
                 timeout => 120
             }
         }
     }
```

* the final event is exactly the same than example #1
* the key point is the "||=" ruby operator.  
it allows to initialize 'sql_duration' map entry to 0 only if this map entry is not already initialized


## How it works
- the filter needs a "task_id" to correlate events (log lines) of a same task
- at the task beggining, filter creates a map, attached to task_id
- for each event, you can execute code using 'event' and 'map' (for instance, copy an event field to map)
- in the final event, you can execute a last code (for instance, add map data to final event)
- after the final event, the map attached to task is deleted
- in one filter configuration, it is recommanded to define a timeout option to protect the filter against unterminated tasks. It tells the filter to delete expired maps
- if no timeout is defined, by default, all maps older than 1800 seconds are automatically deleted
- finally, if `code` execution raises an exception, the error is logged and event is tagged '_aggregateexception'

## Use Cases
- extract some cool metrics from task logs and push them into task final log event (like in example #1 and #2)
- extract error information in any task log line, and push it in final task event (to get a final document with all error information if any)
- extract all back-end calls as a list, and push this list in final task event (to get a task profile)
- extract all http headers logged in several lines to push this list in final task event (complete http request info)
- for every back-end call, collect call details available on several lines, analyse it and finally tag final back-end call log line (error, timeout, business-warning, ...)
- Finally, task id can be any correlation id matching your need : it can be a session id, a file path, ...

## Aggregate Plugin Options
- **task_id :**  
The expression defining task ID to correlate logs.  
This value must uniquely identify the task in the system.  
This option is required.  
Example value : `"%{application}%{my_task_id}"`  

- **code:**  
The code to execute to update map, using current event.  
Or on the contrary, the code to execute to update event, using current map.  
You will have a 'map' variable and an 'event' variable available (that is the event itself).  
This option is required.  
Example value : `"map['sql_duration'] += event['duration']"`  

- **map_action:**  
Tell the filter what to do with aggregate map (default :  "create_or_update").  
`create`: create the map, and execute the code only if map wasn't created before  
`update`: doesn't create the map, and execute the code only if map was created before  
`create_or_update`: create the map if it wasn't created before, execute the code in all cases  
Default value: `create_or_update`  

- **end_of_task:**  
Tell the filter that task is ended, and therefore, to delete map after code execution.  
Default value: `false`  

- **timeout:**  
The amount of seconds after a task "end event" can be considered lost.  
When timeout occurs for a task, The task "map" is evicted.  
The default value is 0, which means no timeout so no auto eviction.  

- **aggregate_maps_path:**  
The path to file where aggregate maps are stored when logstash stops and are loaded from when logstash starts.  
If not defined, aggregate maps will not be stored at logstash stop and will be lost.   
Must be defined in only one aggregate filter (as aggregate maps are global).  
Example value : `"/path/to/.aggregate_maps"`
