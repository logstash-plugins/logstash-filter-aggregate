# 
# The aim of this filter is to aggregate information available among several events (typically log lines) belonging to a same task,
# and finally push aggregated information into final task event.
#
# You should be very careful to set logstash filter workers to 1 (`-w 1` flag) for this filter to work correctly 
# otherwise events may be processed out of sequence and unexpected results will occur.
# 
# ==== Example #1
# 
# * with these given logs :  
# [source,ruby]
# ----------------------------------
#  INFO - 12345 - TASK_START - start
#  INFO - 12345 - SQL - sqlQuery1 - 12
#  INFO - 12345 - SQL - sqlQuery2 - 34
#  INFO - 12345 - TASK_END - end
# ----------------------------------
# 
# * you can aggregate "sql duration" for the whole task with this configuration :
# [source,ruby]
# ----------------------------------
#  filter {
#    grok {
#      match => [ "message", "%{LOGLEVEL:loglevel} - %{NOTSPACE:taskid} - %{NOTSPACE:logger} - %{WORD:label}( - %{INT:duration:int})?" ]
#    }
#  
#    if [logger] == "TASK_START" {
#      aggregate {
#        task_id => "%{taskid}"
#        code => "map['sql_duration'] = 0"
#        map_action => "create"
#      }
#    }
# 
#    if [logger] == "SQL" {
#      aggregate {
#        task_id => "%{taskid}"
#        code => "map['sql_duration'] += event.get('duration')"
#        map_action => "update"
#      }
#    }
#  
#    if [logger] == "TASK_END" {
#      aggregate {
#        task_id => "%{taskid}"
#        code => "event.set('sql_duration', map['sql_duration'])"
#        map_action => "update"
#        end_of_task => true
#        timeout => 120
#      }
#    }
#  }
# ----------------------------------
#
# * the final event then looks like :  
# [source,ruby]
# ----------------------------------
# {
#        "message" => "INFO - 12345 - TASK_END - end message",
#   "sql_duration" => 46
# }
# ----------------------------------
# 
# the field `sql_duration` is added and contains the sum of all sql queries durations.
# 
# ==== Example #2 : no start event
# 
# * If you have the same logs than example #1, but without a start log :
# [source,ruby]
# ----------------------------------
#  INFO - 12345 - SQL - sqlQuery1 - 12
#  INFO - 12345 - SQL - sqlQuery2 - 34
#  INFO - 12345 - TASK_END - end
# ----------------------------------
# 
# * you can also aggregate "sql duration" with a slightly different configuration : 
# [source,ruby]
# ----------------------------------
#  filter {
#    grok {
#      match => [ "message", "%{LOGLEVEL:loglevel} - %{NOTSPACE:taskid} - %{NOTSPACE:logger} - %{WORD:label}( - %{INT:duration:int})?" ]
#    }
#     
#    if [logger] == "SQL" {
#      aggregate {
#        task_id => "%{taskid}"
#        code => "map['sql_duration'] ||= 0 ; map['sql_duration'] += event.get('duration')"
#      }
#    }
#     
#    if [logger] == "TASK_END" {
#      aggregate {
#        task_id => "%{taskid}"
#        code => "event.set('sql_duration', map['sql_duration'])"
#        end_of_task => true
#        timeout => 120
#      }
#    }
#  }
# ----------------------------------
#
# * the final event is exactly the same than example #1
# * the key point is the "||=" ruby operator. It allows to initialize 'sql_duration' map entry to 0 only if this map entry is not already initialized
#
#
# ==== Example #3 : no end event
#
# Third use case: You have no specific end event. 
#
# A typical case is aggregating or tracking user behaviour. We can track a user by its ID through the events, however once the user stops interacting, the events stop coming in. There is no specific event indicating the end of the user's interaction.
#
# In this case, we can enable the option 'push_map_as_event_on_timeout' to enable pushing the aggregation map as a new event when a timeout occurs.  
# In addition, we can enable 'timeout_code' to execute code on the populated timeout event.
# We can also add 'timeout_task_id_field' so we can correlate the task_id, which in this case would be the user's ID. 
#
# * Given these logs: 
#
# [source,ruby]
# ----------------------------------
# INFO - 12345 - Clicked One
# INFO - 12345 - Clicked Two
# INFO - 12345 - Clicked Three
# ----------------------------------
#
# * You can aggregate the amount of clicks the user did like this:
# 
# [source,ruby]
# ----------------------------------
# filter {
#   grok {
#     match => [ "message", "%{LOGLEVEL:loglevel} - %{NOTSPACE:user_id} - %{GREEDYDATA:msg_text}" ]
#   }
#
#   aggregate {
#     task_id => "%{user_id}"
#     code => "map['clicks'] ||= 0; map['clicks'] += 1;"
#     push_map_as_event_on_timeout => true
#     timeout_task_id_field => "user_id"
#     timeout => 600 # 10 minutes timeout
#     timeout_tags => ['_aggregatetimeout']
#     timeout_code => "event.set('several_clicks', event.get('clicks') > 1)"
#   }
# }
# ----------------------------------
#
# * After ten minutes, this will yield an event like:
#
# [source,json]
# ----------------------------------
# {
#   "user_id": "12345",
#   "clicks": 3,
#   "several_clicks": true,
#     "tags": [
#        "_aggregatetimeout"
#     ]
# }
# ----------------------------------
#
# ==== Example #4 : no end event and tasks come one after the other
# 
# Fourth use case : like example #3, you have no specific end event, but also, tasks come one after the other.  
# That is to say : tasks are not interlaced. All task1 events come, then all task2 events come, ...  
# In that case, you don't want to wait task timeout to flush aggregation map.  
# * A typical case is aggregating results from jdbc input plugin.  
# * Given that you have this SQL query : `SELECT country_name, town_name FROM town`  
# * Using jdbc input plugin, you get these 3 events from :
# [source,json]
# ----------------------------------
#   { "country_name": "France", "town_name": "Paris" }
#   { "country_name": "France", "town_name": "Marseille" }
#   { "country_name": "USA", "town_name": "New-York" }
# ----------------------------------
# * And you would like these 2 result events to push them into elasticsearch :
# [source,json]
# ----------------------------------
#   { "country_name": "France", "town_name": [ "Paris", "Marseille" ] }
#   { "country_name": "USA", "town_name": [ "New-York" ] }
# ----------------------------------
# * You can do that using `push_previous_map_as_event` aggregate plugin option :
# [source,ruby]
# ----------------------------------
#      filter {
#      aggregate {
#          task_id => "%{country_name}"
#          code => "
#           map['town_name'] ||= []
#           event.to_hash.each do |key,value|
#             map[key] = value unless map.has_key?(key)
#             map[key] << value if map[key].is_a?(Array) and !value.is_a?(Array)
#           end
#          "
#          push_previous_map_as_event => true
#          timeout => 5
#          timeout_tags => ['aggregated']
#      }
# 
#      if "aggregated" not in [tags] {
#       drop {}
#      }
#    }
# ----------------------------------
# * The key point is that each time aggregate plugin detects a new `country_name`, it pushes previous aggregate map as a new logstash event (with 'aggregated' tag), and then creates a new empty map for the next country
# * When 5s timeout comes, the last aggregate map is pushed as a new event
# * Finally, initial events (which are not aggregated) are dropped because useless
# 
# 
# ==== How it works
# * the filter needs a "task_id" to correlate events (log lines) of a same task
# * at the task beggining, filter creates a map, attached to task_id
# * for each event, you can execute code using 'event' and 'map' (for instance, copy an event field to map)
# * in the final event, you can execute a last code (for instance, add map data to final event)
# * after the final event, the map attached to task is deleted
# * in one filter configuration, it is recommanded to define a timeout option to protect the feature against unterminated tasks. It tells the filter to delete expired maps
# * if no timeout is defined, by default, all maps older than 1800 seconds are automatically deleted
# * all timeout options have to be defined in only one aggregate filter per task_id pattern. Timeout options are : timeout, timeout_code, push_map_as_event_on_timeout, push_previous_map_as_event, timeout_task_id_field, timeout_tags 
# * if `code` execution raises an exception, the error is logged and event is tagged '_aggregateexception'
#
#
# ==== Use Cases
# * extract some cool metrics from task logs and push them into task final log event (like in example #1 and #2)
# * extract error information in any task log line, and push it in final task event (to get a final event with all error information if any)
# * extract all back-end calls as a list, and push this list in final task event (to get a task profile)
# * extract all http headers logged in several lines to push this list in final task event (complete http request info)
# * for every back-end call, collect call details available on several lines, analyse it and finally tag final back-end call log line (error, timeout, business-warning, ...)
# * Finally, task id can be any correlation id matching your need : it can be a session id, a file path, ...
